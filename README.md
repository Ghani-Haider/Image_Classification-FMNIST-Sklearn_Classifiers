# Image Classification: FMNIST Dataset using Sklearn Classifiers

Given a Fashion-MNIST dataset comprising of 28x28 grayscale images of 60,000 fashion products from 10 categories, a scikit-learn based classifier is built for this dataset to classify each input image into one (out of 10) categories. Experimented with five to six different classifiers and repored accuracy of each of them.
